                        Tety is a 15 year old gamer & game designer all the way in the miserable hell called "East Midlands, United Kingdom".
                        He LOVES to torture himself with the <span title="Attempt to perform arithmetic (add) on nil and number">funny red text</span> that shows up in the terminal when you make a mistake in your code.

                            <li><span>Game Design</span><br>Ever since June 2020, the moment it clicked into his head, he has been very addicted to scripting in ROBLOX Studio.
                                He has used a few other game engines as well, but ROBLOX Studio was (and still pretty much is) his best home to this day.</li>
                            <li><span>Video Editing</span><br>Since (probably) 2015, he was constantly working on videos for his Youtube channel.
                                There were a few good videos, but most of them were just as bad as his common sense.
                            </li>
                            <li><span>Web Development</span><br>This is his first ever actual website.
                                He hasn't really touched HTML or CSS before, except the times he messed with websites at school when he was bored,
                                or was just editing text on google definitions,
                                and the one time he made a card on <a href="https://github.com/Syknapse/Contribute-To-This-Project">that github contribution project.</a>
                                Thanks to his great knowledge of general programming, however, this isn't as hard as it would be.

                            <li><span>Game Design</span><br>Mostly from home, by friends and online tutorials/forums,
                                had some primary school lessons around Scratch,
                                and secondary CS lessons around <a href="https://www.pygame.org">the pygame library.</a>
                            </li>
                            <li><span>Video Editing</span><br>Started in ~2015, used Vegas Pro 15 and mostly just used the fading and text, until ~2018, when he switched to Hitfilm Express.
                                He watched a tutorial on motion tracking (about 4 times) and used it pretty well. Also used the FX that came with his Content Creator package.
                                He then switched to Davinci Resolve in 2022 after Hitfilm's revamp, which completely rid him of the addons he paid for.
                                <br><i>(Not that it wasn't unfair. The package WAS cheap, and they must've removed the old addon system because of lisencing problems.)</i>

                            <li><span>Web Development</span><br>Making this page based on a tutorial</li>
